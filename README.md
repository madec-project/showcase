# ezVIS showcase

This repository is a showcase for [ezVIS](https://github.com/madec-project/ezvis): data and configuration files.

There are several cases:
- basis configuration, useful to see one mechanism at a time in action
- demos, where data and a more complete configuration are given
- ... maybe configurations alone for the cases where data is not public.

Each directory contains a directory named `repository` and a `repository.json` configuration file.

Once `ezvis` is installed, if you want to see an example in action, use a command prompt (or CLI, or shell, or whatever is its name in your operating system), and go into the example directory.

Then, type:

```
ezvis repository
```

> **Note**: `assets` directory is not a case, it contains only assets useful for READMEs.
